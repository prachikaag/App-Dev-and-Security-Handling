1) What are the two types of Intents?

    The two types of intents in Android are:
    a. Implicit Intent
    b. Explicit Intent

    Implicit Intent - We don't know who will handle our action/ app. This intent belongs outside your application.
        Here no component is specified still action is performed
        Example -
        In our assignment in SecondFragment.kt in line 69 we declare an implicit intent

    Explicit Intent - Here we know who will handle our action/ app.
        Here external class to be provoke is provided by the intent, component is specified
        Example -
        In our assignment in ThirdFragment.kt in line 68 we declare an explicit intent

2) Which of the two types of Intents is (generally) more secure?

    Implicit intents are generally much safer. To communicate between different apps we can use an
    implicit intent with an app chooser, non-exported content providers and signature based content.

3) What type of Intent is shown on lines 69 to 73 of SecondFragment.kt?

    Implicit intent, as the intent type is Intent.ACTION_VIEW

4) What type of Intent is shown on lines 68 to 70 of ThirdFragment.kt?

    Explicit intent, as we specify the intent type as activity, ProductScrollingActivity::class.java

5) Which of these two Intents is the proper way to do an Intent?

    Explicit Intent

In SecondFragment.kt we fix lines by coverting it to an explicit intent to prevent untrusted
applications from obtaining data. As inplicit intent does not specify a particular application
which should receive the data, allowing any application using an IntentFilter to process the
sensitive data.
